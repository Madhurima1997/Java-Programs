# Decorator Pattern
<hr>

### Quick Notes
- Attach additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.
- They have same supertypes as the objects
- It's like a wrapper around the object that we want to decorate
- Follows composition method
- <b>Single Responsibility Principle.</b> You can divide a monolithic class that implements many possible variants of behavior into several smaller classes.
- Falls under <b>Open-Closed Principle</b>

### OO Principle
<b> Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification</b>
